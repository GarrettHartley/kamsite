		<h1>Snakes on a Plane and X-men in a Poem</h1>
		<p>'''I have died as a moth. 
I have slept for one hundred thousand years a lived to tell the tale to you. 
My child, we ate at Panera bread on a Sunday ‘eve, 
But there is a certain conversation lost. 
My dear, I have lived another two hundred thousand years.

In the Sycamore mall, we saw X-men III. 
There is an un-writable feeling I must write to stay true. 
Nobody remains to register who had been lost in the light. 
Not northern lights, nor the natural law 
Could make me un-afraid to dream of Genosha. 

After watching X-men, we walked. 
Target had a lot of things. We ate Panera Bread. 
Squatting and loitering on a stool, nearby a stall, 
I realized the contrast between X-men and Target.  
It reminds me of how we had our talk. 
We talked out right, because there was no one home. 
And the lights flickered on and off. 
On was X-men. Off was Target. Panera is in-between. 

When I watch X-men it feels like anything can happen, but walking around Target is the opposite 
And it’s weird to have them so close together. 
Orange Julius does a good job at bridging the gap.
There are larva in my mom’s raisin bran(d).
