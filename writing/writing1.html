		<h1>Miss Me Miss Ocean This Is My Motion</h1>
		<p>'''In 2039 they sat in a poorly lit, five-sided shed in Southern marshes bordering the Gulf coastline and had spent the last three hours discussing the day-to-day mood cycles of Megan’s suicidal hibernation that she was now two months into, and whether or not she should kill herself— due to 3 main reasons and one little reason, that their “little talks had gone too far”, and due to the length of the conversation and the humidity, John's comments had lost clarity, but the conversation continued, digressing gradually into a dim confusion, they did not face each other, but rather each occupied their own space, Megan on a mattress and John on a metal chair, separated by stacks of wooden dowels, a glass tank, and a hamster inside the tank.
“You can swim with dolphins,” John slowly stated this truth about the world he’d realized yesterday. "You can swim with dolphins. There is water, and dolphins, and you control a body that knows how to swim. I think they will let you swim with them. Therefore, you shouldn’t do it."
Megan didn’t say anything.
	“I’ve seen them, and they are worth every bit of it.”
	“I wouldn’t know.”
	“Why”
	“I haven’t seen them.”
	“No, you wouldn’t have.”
	“I might have”
	“No.”
	“I’ve been around penguins. You saying that doesn’t prove anything.”
	“On the internet?”
	“No in real life. That is obviously what we are talking about.”
“It was a question. Anyways, I’ve seen them. They are worth it.”
“Okay, come sit over here,” she motioned to a chair.
John surveyed the distance separating himself from her, can I span it? 
	“Come sit next to me.”
	“It is a true thing about the world that you can swim with dolphins, do you understand what I am saying?”
	“I don’t give a shit. You’re being autistic.”
	“Look, I don’t know what to say anymore.” 
John looked up again, can I span it? 
	“Should I kill myself?” Megan asked.
	“Should I kill myself?”
	“Yes”
	“Why?” John asked. 
	“Because you might learn what is next. You’ve learned everything worth learning here.”
	“But I enjoy life.”
	“Exactly, and I don’t.”
	“Try swimming with dolphins why don’t you?”
	“Have you ever done it?”
	“No, but I’ve seen them.”
	“You’ve never done it. I knew it. That is why you think it's great.”
	“But what about the act itself? Pulling a trigger with a cold metal barrel up against your head? I enjoy moving and eating and being alive.” John patted his forearms.
	“Your forearms look like fishbellies.”
	“After the trigger, a decaying body. Does that not go against life? The act of it sounds so messy. Won’t it be messy?”
	“I know what you mean. But after laying in bed for so long, I feel the opposite. It sounds clean,” Megan said while shifting about the mattress. “Come sit over here why don’t you?”
“Why so you can kill me?”
	“Yes”
	“Hold on”
	“Sit over here, it's the least you can do.”
	John stood up to span the distance. He stopped half-way and picked up the hamster, then walked to her side.
	“How would you like to me to sit?”
	“Can you put it back?”
	“I,”
	“I’m not thinking straight, it’s okay”
	“No, it’s okay”
	“I was calm before, I don’t know what is happening now.”
	“Are you scared?”
	“John”
	“What”
	“I’ve told you. Now come here.”
	John sat on the mattress with his back against the drywall. He turned his squished pair of green eyes towards Megan’s hands on her lap.
“Are you gonna put it back?” her commanding voice turned shaky.
“The hamster? No.” John handed her the hamster, “here.” 

She took it. 

”I can tell you’re nervous, you shouldn’t do it,” he said. 

“Tell me the reasons you said were not-sad reasons,” he said after a long silence.

“Why are the dolphins not okay?” he asked her gently.

“Shut up. Just shut it. You want to know the most interesting thing I’ve learned recently?”

“Sure”

“The other day I focused and heard four new frequencies coming from that fan. That’s the kind of stuff I’m into now. It reminded me of this weird sensation, associated to this one time at soccer practice in high school. This was before integration. I was hungry and standing there with my knees locked, probably with low blood sugar, and I felt something. It wasn’t happy or sad or anything, just a unique overwhelming sense of awe mixed with a sense of feeling fucked in the universe. It’s not great. It’s not bad. It’s not anything. Really, it really isn’t anything. It is remarkable how nothing it is. The only, the only thing it is is indescribable. It immediately reminded me of playing video games at Erin Castle’s house. Now every time something odd happens, like hearing four new frequencies in the fan, my mind thinks “Erin Castle - soccer practice - that feeling”, usually in that order. And I’ve never told anyone this until now. It’s such a thrill to have someone listen you know? It’s such a thrill to reveal new information. Too bad there isn’t anyone else that wants to listen. Too bad that’s the last interesting thing I have kept from telling you. And learning something, oh god, forget that. I promise there isn’t anything else there”

“Why are you so obsessed with learning? You know there are other pleasures.”

“Please you make it sound like I’m about to take up sex work. Want to go dick around in some G-clubs with me? Ha! A bottom barrell loser like me? I’m fucking depressed. I’m fucked. I’m out.”

“Why don’t you try swimming with dolphins?”

“Have you ever swallowed sea water?”

“Directly swallowed? No.”

“Yeah”

“But that’s not important. We can shove a pacifier in your mouth or something.”

“I won’t be able to breathe.”

“Your nose”

“Do they have oxygen tanks that come through the nose?”

“No. No gas tank. You’ll breathe air.”

“No oxygen tank?”

“Yeah, you breathe when you surface. Like normal swimming.”

“But the water will leak into my nose.”

“But not your mouth right? You won’t taste it.”

“But I’ll smell it.”

“But the taste from sea water is the actual taste. For fungus, or bacteria, or green peas the taste is mostly the smell. Having bacteria shoved up your nose would be worse than shoved into your mouth with your nose pinched, right? But with sea water, it’s the salt that makes it unbearable, salt, one of the five tastes. You can solve this with a pacifier.”

“If it was the scent that was unbearable, I could find a thing that pinches my nose.”

“Those are harder to find”

“We’re traveling to the Caribbean and we can’t stop for a nose clip?”

“No not the Caribbean. There are dolphins here in the Gulf. You’re not connected?”

“I haven’t been connected for a couple months, I told you that. I should revoke the joy I felt in telling you about my feelings. Maybe I you can listen this time and I can squeeze a little more joy out of life before,"

“Don’t, I just forgot. Anyways the dolphins are here. I saw them as a kid.”

“The cute kind?”

“Bottlenose, yeah.”

“I wish it was the scent that was unbearable. I could find a nose clip and breathe with my mouth as I prefer.”

“You would swallow the sea water and get sick. You are lucky.” 

“If I was lucky God would have let me retain my blowhole from evolution as a vestigial appendage.”

John gasped, “don’t say words like that. This isn’t a time for words like that,” he tried at a joke but her neck stayed motionless, bent downwards. 

“We don’t want to kill off that impressive vocabulary now do we?”

“Yes keep talking. That will help.”

“You know I don’t owe you anything, right? You know the universe doesn’t owe you anything?”

“You did start it.”

“You can frame anything like that. You’re responsible for it.”

“Yeah, bad habits,” she muttered to herself.

They stopped talking. John lifted his sweatshirt hood. Fifty years ago they would have had kids. John and Megan, born fifty years ago, a crew of two in Baldwin, Alabama. "A crew of two," he let slip through his mouth, "a crew... of two." 
	"What’s good?" she asked.
	"A crew of two. Fifty years ago, with kids."
	“Dolphins," he muttered inaudibly to change is answer.
	“I feel like... this is the correct ending, and it has to be a tragedy for it all to make sense. Is there anything fine left for me to learn? Tell me, something about this world.”
	“I thought it wasn’t emotional.”
“It’s not. But in the end, my mind needs to make it that way, doesn’t it?”
“Yeah.”
	Wind from a dark outside blew fresh humid air into the shed’s screen window above their heads. but he still listened to Megan as she recited her 3 “not-sad” reasons and repeatedly assured herself that her feeling moments prior to committing the act were in line with “harmony of nature and natural processes”. John shuffled his body around, swung his legs overtop of her, laid down by her side.
	“From cuddled to killed, impossible fifty years ago,” John said out loud. 
He tapped his thumbs against her arms in rhythm with the snare and bass drums of the slow-paced song playing from her iPhone, something he’d always done, a cornerstone of their relationship, it was perhaps the last piece of their relationship left unspoken. Like a junkie beating something into the dirt, all the other small nuances had been yanked into conscious conversation by a hidden, anxious version of John that consistently expressed its dissatisfaction by ruining quiet moments with stories of his childhood, thoughts from that day, and pointing out these small nuances in their relationship, like this habit of tapping drum beats while holding her. Somehow though, he’d never communicated this one. 
John now imagined a physical drum head with rows of springs beneath the hollow interior being struck by a wooden stick in order to create gradients in sound pressure that move an inductor coil inside a microphone, the electric signal stored in flash memory, and the inductor coil in her speaker now vibrating air back towards the mechanically-gated ion channels in his inner ear, sending a nervous signal of a snare drum sound to his mind. The image of the tight, vibrating drum head, inside a cloud of settling dust, as if just beaten into the ground by a junkie, now framed his relationship with Megan. 
The two were similar in so many ways. They were so similar, it had changed John’s intuition towards the diversity of life on earth’s crust. Like a pebble glued into an asphalt road, spending one-hundred years pressed against a pebble of nearly identical size and shape, his intuition towards what should and should not be expected of a neighbor was altered and out of touch with reality. 
Life in 2039 was different than it was for the mound builders who occupied the land 7000 years prior. John let his mind slip, and thought of his life as phases, like thick leaves representing different phases of his time, woven into a mat that represented his life. Just as each leaf’s growth was framed in an environment, a tree branch, that preceded the leaf’s existence, so too were the phases of his life organized by cultural norms that preceded him spawning into his home 22 years ago-- high-school, internships, vacations, and college, all split into several mini-phases, occurring with different moods that were strongly related to the climate of the city he lived in, the season, the music he listened to, and his main daily activity. The final hour of each phase, from age 20 until now, was nostalgia. Then, later, the nostalgia for a given phase came back and bite him, intensely, a total of two to three more times after the phase was over and he had moved into a new one. The gaps of air separating the leaves in the mat were the final-hour nostalgic moments separating phases in his life. It was the pain associated with the desperate knowledge that phases could not be re-created, that he would be pushed to his life’s next period by forces inside his culture and outside his freedom. Because he was a bitch, he thought, he had to pass through every rite of passage, every hoop his culture threw at him, before he could stand free at the edge of the last hoop and know what total human freedom, limited by only a body, felt like. This woven, leafy mat, which represented his life, was now placed underneath the snare drum, in order to frame his relationship with Megan more completely.
John opened his eyes to look at the person he was spooning, currently and partially a monster to him now, and thought about the fact she liked Led Zeppelin. Her original appeal to him was nothing more than an idea inside his own mind. She was supposed to curb the nostalgia that separated the life-phases whose barriers felt so sharp, and blend his life into one. A single, thin, common thread inside the mat of leaves separated by thick air-gaps of nostalgia, of people who didn’t understand or care about his past. Reality, however, is unpredictable. A cliche photograph of a water-droplet about to fall off a waterfall, labeled ‘life is unpredictable’ now replaced the snare drum and mat. 
	The fact an isolated water-droplet about to fall off a waterfall cannot be photographed in a way that makes sense, but his mind thought of it anyway, was related to the fact Megan’s appeal was nothing more of an idea inside his own head. His naivety in assuming his projections of ‘their relationship’ would definitely materialize, and after achieving this ideal would persist in a steady state, a state that somehow would allow them to remain interested in life and each other until they died of old age, was nothing more than a misjudgement, a glitch in his thinking, like him accidentally believing that a water-droplet inside a river could maybe be photographed. Or forgetting to turn off the coffee machine.
Megan said, “I’m calm now. I’m ready”. 
“Ready to move on?”
“Yeah.”
“Okay, tell me your reasons, calmly this time.”
Megan calmly gave her speech, stated the three not-sad reasons, and still felt calm.
Laying in bed holding each other had always felt lethargic and anti-productive. The proactive one who motivated the other to move on always “won the game”. Right now, Megan moving on, exploring death, was the ultimate, proactive adventure. John muttered, “You win,” in the context of his thoughts. Megan misinterpreted this statement as permission to kill herself, though it may as well have been interpreted correctly. John didn’t say anything.
	As John let her go, he felt the image of himself he’d pressed into her mind slip away, and became acutely aware of what he was in that moment: a consciousness, an object that could move, and an image that resided in the consciousness of others. She was going to throw away a third of him. The image he pressed into her mind their first night together came rushing now towards him now, in an unavoidable way.

<p>'''
	After Megan killed herself, John spent a great deal of time trying to elucidate her suicide note, the details of which deviated from their conversation in the smallest, most annoying of ways. The letter had mentioned “learning everything on Wikipedia” four times, and contained several pieces of her conversation with John from the night before. As a token to their past life she transcribed by hand the voice recordings on her iPhone before taking vodka and 1 gram of Xanax on the General W.K. Wilson Bridge. After locking her cloud, she laid down on the guardrail to let chaos theory and the position of nearby atoms determine the fate of her carcass— on one side, a river, and on the other, a road. The iPhone, now a waterlogged array of tightly packed silicon wafers, was thirty feet under the river’s surface, rendering the conversation contained in the voice recordings less accessible, but still existent. Pieces of the conversation were in the letter, pieces in John’s memory, and the full copy in two places both inaccessible to humans: Megan’s locked gspace in the UN cloud, inaccessible to humans, now locked by policy was contained in the waterlogged iPhone and the position of water molecules, transferred from the iPhone to the river water and spilt into the Gulf of Mexico.
	John’s copy of the conversation in his memory noticed certain parts of the letter did not match what Megan had said that night.  For example, “Wikipedia” had replaced “YouTube”, as Megan’s metonym for the internet in reason number 1, in a list of 2 reasons for why she committed the act: All the boring questions have been answered in an uninteresting fashion by…  Wikipedia … The 2nd reason, however, matched John’s memory— it concerned a feeling described by Megan as “a lack of surety; in particular, not feeling “in the mood” to arbitrarily choose physical actions with moral implications that were incalculable. The manner her letter deviated from her speech was quite annoying. John thought back to the night before— he recalled an image of Megan raising three fingers, stating there were three not-sad reasons she wanted to kill herself, and saying the word “YouTube” a lot. “YouTube” and “her education” had delivered the collective body of human knowledge to her on a “shit-platter”, she had used the word shit-platter…  and said human knowledge should be learned in other ways, if one is to live to eighty years old and remain interested in life, and then lowered her second finger, stated a third reason, and lowered her third finger into a fist. But the letter did not have a third reason, nor the word “shit-platter”. These realizations came to John as he read and re-read her letter on his couch, for several hours, with a little bit of food.
	Life continued for him. Sunlight came through the blinds hitting his torso in horizontal strips. He ran his fingers down the grooves in the pole while focusing on how the sun rays felt on his open skin, and whether or not he could feel heat in separate horizontal stripes. He closed his eyes and used his gspace settings to adjust his skin’s sensitivity back and forth, narrowing in on the point where the individual horizontal lines could be resolved by his nerves. “Interesting questions that cannot be answered until I die,” John said, and then realized he had not spoken for a long time.
	John finished the last month of his Master’s degree in mechanical engineering and had a professional career developing software to characterize metal dislocations. His work aided a metallurgy research group in Sweden develop slightly stronger metals to use as pressure plates in the braking system of aircraft - rover hybrids. '''</p>
